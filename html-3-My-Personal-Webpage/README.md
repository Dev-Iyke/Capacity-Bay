This is the third capacity bay task. 

THE FINAL HTML TASK:
1. Create a copy of this webpage https://uniquezee.github.io/my-personal-website/ with your own details
2. Check the links they point to different pages, my hobby points us to a page where our hobbies list is created which are links that point to our YouTube channel (can be any link), and it has a go back link, which takes us to the home link
3. The contact me takes us to a form page, that has a back to home link
4. Your Form should have an action attribute of "mailto: your email address"

Check the webpage and rebuild it with your own details
Every thing

You can use this site to circle your image: https://crop-circle.imageonline.co/

When done, create a GitHub repository with the name "my personal webpage" and upload your files to the GitHub repository

Tweak the webpage to how you like it, using what you have learnt so far but do not add a form of Css styling, just HTML should do

Read the questions carefully, any questions, send me a message

Looking forward to seeing a Great Job for you all.
